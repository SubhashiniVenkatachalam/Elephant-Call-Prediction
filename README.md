# Predicting Individual-Specific Elephant Calls Using Machine Learning

This project was developed as part of the *Data Mining* course in the Master of Computer Information Systems (MCIS) program at Colorado State University.

## 🐘 Project Overview
The goal was to predict whether an elephant vocalization is directed toward a specific individual based on contextual and acoustic features. This classification task helps understand animal communication and has potential applications in conservation monitoring.

## 🔍 Problem Statement
Identifying individual-specific calls in wild elephants is a complex challenge due to variability in behavior and environment. Machine learning offers a scalable solution to identify such patterns.

## 🛠️ Tools & Techniques
- **Platform:** KNIME Analytics Platform
- **Models Used:**
  - Decision Tree (75.6% Accuracy)
  - Logistic Regression
  - Neural Network (RProp MLP)
- **Key Features:** Frequency, Harmonics, Call Type, Distance to Caller, Certainty Metrics

## 📈 Results
- The **Decision Tree** model performed best with 75.6% accuracy and a good balance of precision and recall.
- Acoustic and spatial features showed strong predictive power.
